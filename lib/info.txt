"I" statements as in, “I manage teams...” whereas third person (as exemplified above) uses “he/him” or “she/her" as in "She manages teams ..." You will find 'About Me' statements written both ways.

Most important is that you choose one and remain consistent, rather than alternating between the two:

If you’re writing the ‘About’ statement on a business website, it’s generally advised to use third person ("She supervises ...").
If your website is a personal portfolio or blog, it’s best to use first person ("I have ten years of experience ...").
Don’t ramble. Most likely, your reader’s attention span isn’t going to be very long. Try to keep your statement to less than 250 words.

Include an image. If you’re promoting your expertise, consider adding a photo to your page. A professional headshot, like you use on LinkedIn, will work perfectly.
